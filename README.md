# KaraSoko

**Author:** Angela Zhang

**Design:** KaraSoko is a puzzle game based on the box-pushing game (Sokoban) with memory game elements. Along with having to push the box around, player must also memorize a sequence of colors and manipulate the box to pass over corresponding colored buttons in the given order.

## How Your Asset Pipeline Works

Art created in https://www.pixilart.com/draw# and exported into a .png format. These png files are stored in the `assets` folder.

`asset_processing.cpp` is responsible for converting these png files into a readable format by the PPU. We read in all png files, and for each one, we split the image into blocks of 8 (the size of a tile) and extract the palette colors and tile patterns from this block. If there are any invalid images (i.e. has more than 4 colors that wouldn't fit in a palette) or more images than expected, we throw an error.

For each image, we create a `LoadedSprite`, which stores each of these 8x8 blocks, their tile index, and their relative locations. It also contains the name for the sprite (taken from the png file name) and a function that draws out the entire sprite given a position and reference to the ppu.

To process all the assets, you need to run in the `15-466-game1` directory:
```
% jam && assets/LoadAssets
```

This will output chunk files into `dist/resources` containing the tile table, palette table, and a table of sprite information. These chunks are loaded when running the game; the tile table and palette table are stored in the ppu, and the `LoadedSprite` is loaded into a map from the sprite name to the `LoadedSprite` called `sprite_mapping`. When a sprite needs to be drawn, we use `sprite_mapping` to get the corresponding sprite and all the information related to it.

## How To Play

Compile and run the game by running in the `15-466-game1` directory:
```
% jam && dist/KaraSoko
```
